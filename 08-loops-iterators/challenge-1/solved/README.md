### Add the numbers of the number

* For this challenge you will need to create a function called `addNumbers()`. 
* The addNumbers function should accept a number as a parameter. 
* The function should check to see if the number is between 11 and 999 (inclusive of 11 and 999). If it is not between 11 and 999, return a string that says "Invalid Number".
* After you check the number then you need to find a way to add the numbers that make up the number together and return the total amount. Example: if you are given 752 as your number you will need to find a way to add 7+5+2 and return the total which would be 14.
